## 🧩 How Everything Connects

- **main.jsx**: Bootstraps the app, wraps it in Redux `<Provider>`, and renders `<App />`.
- **App.jsx**: Lays out the main UI, including the gradient background and two core components: `<Hero />` and `<Demo />`.
- **Hero.jsx**: Top section with logo, branding, and tagline.
- **Demo.jsx**: The heart of the app! Handles user input, fetches summaries, manages history, and displays results.
- **services/article.js**: Defines the API slice using Redux Toolkit Query. Handles all communication with the summarization API.
- **services/store.js**: Configures the Redux store and middleware.
- **assets/**: All images and SVGs (logo, icons, loader, etc.) are imported via `assets/index.js` for easy access.
- **App.css & index.css**: Tailwind and custom styles for a beautiful, responsive UI.

## 🔗 Data Flow & Summarization Logic

1. **User enters an article URL** in the Demo component.
2. **Demo.jsx** dispatches a Redux Toolkit Query to the summarization API.
3. **API key** is securely loaded from `.env` (`VITE_RAPID_API_ARTICLE_KEY`).
4. **API response** (summary) is displayed and saved to localStorage for history.
5. **User can copy** the summary or revisit previous summaries.

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Add your API key:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root:
   ```
   VITE_RAPID_API_ARTICLE_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
   ```
3. **Start the dev server:**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open in browser:**  
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 📝 Is Anything Missing?

- **API Key Required!**  
  You must provide your own RapidAPI key for the summarization to work.
- **No backend/server code** – this is a pure frontend app.
- **All major features are implemented and the project is complete.**
- **No test suite** – consider adding tests for production use.

## 💡 Creative Touches

- 🟠 **Gradient backgrounds** and SVG grids for a modern look.
- 📝 **Clipboard and feedback icons** for a smooth UX.
- 🕒 **History** of all your summaries, saved locally.
- ⚡ **Super-fast** thanks to Vite and Tailwind.

## Technical Interview Q&A

### 1. Project Overview
##### Q: What is ClarityCut, and what problem does it solve?
A: ClarityCut is a React-based web app that summarizes articles in seconds using OpenAI’s GPT-4 API (via RapidAPI). It solves the problem of information overload by distilling long-form content into concise, clear takeaways, improving comprehension and saving time.

### 2. Tech Stack
##### Q: Why did you choose React for this project?
A: React’s component-based architecture makes it easy to build reusable UI elements and manage state efficiently. Its virtual DOM and declarative style help in creating fast, responsive, and maintainable user interfaces.

##### Q: Why Redux Toolkit Query instead of plain Redux or Context API?
A: Redux Toolkit Query simplifies data fetching, caching, and API state management. It reduces boilerplate compared to plain Redux and provides automatic caching, invalidation, and request deduplication, which keeps the app performant.

##### Q: Why Vite over Create React App?
A: Vite offers faster dev server startup, instant hot module replacement, and optimized production builds. Its ES module-based architecture significantly reduces build times compared to Create React App.

### 3. Architecture & Data Flow
##### Q: Can you explain the data flow in ClarityCut?
A:
User enters an article URL in Demo.jsx.
Demo.jsx calls the RTK Query API slice (article.js).
The API slice fetches data from RapidAPI using the provided key.
On success, the summary is stored in Redux state and localStorage.
The UI updates to show the summary and history list.

##### Q: How is localStorage used in this app?
A: LocalStorage is used to persist summary history so that users can revisit previous summaries even after refreshing the page.

### 4. API & Security
##### Q: How do you handle API keys in a frontend-only app?
A: I store the API key in an .env file, accessed via Vite’s import.meta.env. While this hides the key in development, frontend keys can be exposed in the browser, so for production I’d use a backend proxy to keep keys secure.

##### Q: How do you handle API errors?
A: RTK Query provides error and isError states. I display a user-friendly error message if the request fails (e.g., invalid URL, API limit exceeded) and disable the submit button during fetches to prevent repeated calls.

### 5. Performance
##### Q: How is performance optimized in ClarityCut?
A:
Vite ensures minimal bundle size and fast hot reloads.
RTK Query caches API responses to avoid redundant network calls.
LocalStorage avoids repeated API hits for previously fetched summaries.
Tailwind CSS’s utility classes reduce unused CSS through tree-shaking.

### 6. UI/UX
##### Q: How did you ensure the UI is responsive?
A: Tailwind CSS’s responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) allow me to adjust layout and typography based on screen size. I also used SVGs for icons to ensure crisp visuals on all devices.

##### Q: How did you make the user experience smoother?
A: Added a loader animation during fetch, copy-to-clipboard functionality for quick sharing, and history persistence for revisiting summaries.

### 7. Testing & Deployment
##### Q: How would you test this app?
A:
Unit Tests: Test article.js API slice using Jest/Vitest with mock responses.
Component Tests: Use React Testing Library to ensure Demo.jsx renders summaries correctly.
Integration Tests: Simulate the full user flow from URL entry to summary display.

##### Q: How did you deploy ClarityCut?
A: Deployed via Netlify. I ran npm run build to generate an optimized dist folder and connected the GitHub repo to Netlify for automatic deployments on push.

### 8. Scalability & Future Enhancements
##### Q: How would you scale ClarityCut for heavy traffic?
A: Move API requests to a backend service to handle authentication, caching, and rate-limiting. Use a CDN for assets, and implement server-side caching for frequently accessed URLs.

##### Q: What future features would you add?
A:
Multi-language summarization.
Export to PDF/Text.
Dark mode toggle.
OAuth login to sync history across devices.

### 9. React & Redux Specifics
##### Q: How does RTK Query differ from Axios?
A: Axios is a low-level HTTP client for making requests, while RTK Query is a state management layer on top of Redux that integrates fetching, caching, and lifecycle handling in a declarative way.

##### Q: How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React?
A: I use React.memo for pure components, selector memoization in Redux, and RTK Query’s automatic caching to avoid refetching unchanged data.

### 10. Security & Edge Cases
##### Q: How do you handle malicious URLs or invalid inputs?
A: Validate the URL format using regex before making API calls and sanitize the input to prevent script injection. Also, limit the number of requests per session to avoid abuse.

##### Q: Could this app work offline?
A: Yes, partially — users can still access summaries saved in localStorage, but new summaries require an internet connection.
